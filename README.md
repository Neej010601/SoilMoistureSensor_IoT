# SoilMoistureSensor_IoT
In this repo we have a code for getting the data of soil moisture and the on the basis of data the motor can turn on automatically.

Parts Required:
1)ESP32 (ESP32 is a feature-rich MCU with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for a wide-range of applications.)

2)Soil Moisture sensor (This is an easy to use analog digital soil moisture sensor.
Just insert the sensor in the soil and it can can measure moisture or water level content in it.
It gives a lower output voltage on wet soil and vice versa.)  

3)DHT11 (DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor features a temperature & humidity sensor
complex with a calibrated digital signal output. By using the exclusive digital-signal-acquisition
technique and temperature & humidity sensing technology, it ensures high reliability and
excellent long-term stability. This sensor includes a resistive-type humidity measurement
component and an NTC temperature measurement component, and connects to a highperformance 8-bit microcontroller,
offering excellent quality, fast response, anti-interference
ability and cost-effectiveness.)

4)Relay (A relay allows circuits to be switched by electrical equipment: for example, a timer circuit with a relay could switch power at a preset time.
For many years relays were the standard method of controlling industrial electronic systems.)

5)Water Pump Module (The Single Pumping Module includes 1 water pump. The Dual Pumping Module includes 1 main water pump and 1 stand-by water pump.
These water pumping modules are designed for maintaining proper water flow as the water is recirculated throughout your induction system.)

6)BreadBoard (A breadboard (sometimes called a plugblock) is used for building temporary circuits.
It is useful to designers because it allows components to be removed and replaced easily.
It is useful to the person who wants to build a circuit to demonstrate its action, then to reuse the components in another circuit.)

7)Jumper Wires (A jumper wire is an electric wire that connects remote electric circuits used for printed circuit boards.
By attaching a jumper wire on the circuit, it can be short-circuited and short-cut (jump) to the electric circuit.)
